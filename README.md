Objective - To develop and design a Smart Toy for kids aging in-between 3 years to 8 years.

Aim - The user should be able to play around with toy using it's ability to Self Navigate and should be to have basic conversation with it using the AI Chatbot feature.

Tool & Technology Used - 

Tools - 
1. Raspberry Pi 3B
2. 2 Servo motors to help the attached Pi CAM to rotate in 180 & 360 degrees.
3. 2 DC Motors to control the displacement of project body
4. 3.5 inches Waveshare LCD Touchscreen display which display the UI which will display the AI chatbot's output prompt.

Technology - 
1. Python for Machine Learning & Embedded Programming.
2. Python PyQT5 for User Interface development.
3. FIGMA for UI wireframing and designing.

Conclusion & Results - 
We successfully achieved our project's goals and objectives. The AI chatbot feature was developed without needing to purchase any OpenAI model. The robot effectively navigated around obstacles, though due to time constraints, we couldn't fully implement the lock-in and follow-user functionalities. Image recognition using YOLOv5 was successfully implemented. Additionally, we designed and developed a user interface that enhances the robot's toy-like appeal.
